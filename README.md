# nRFSampleSwiftApp_iOS
Sample Bluetooth LE for UART application using iOS swift, this gives users an idea on how to pass the object to other view controller scenes. The code is referenced from Adafruit Basic Chat, nRF Toolbox, and several online forums. 
This is just an experimental app to communicate with Bluetooth LE using iOS, if I have missed to add any license please fell free to let me know so i can put that in.
The class files are extracted from Adafruit Basic Chat repo and several swift developers and web forums helped me through the process. 
The App is used to connect to a Nordic ble, and send and receive byte array data and pass the connected peripheral to several view controller scenes and write/read data from those classes.

App source code is extracted from:
